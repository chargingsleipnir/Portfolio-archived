    <br><br><strong>About the Fire Truck:</strong><br>
    <p>
        This was a midterm project using Blender. Building the models was great, but I was shocked to find how much I enjoyed animating!
        I was so happy to spend every waking hour setting keyframes, manipulating f-curves, and doing as much with my 60 seconds as possible.
        Try not to quake in your boots!
