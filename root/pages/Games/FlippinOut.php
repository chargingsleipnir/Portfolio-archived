<br><strong>Flippin' Out / Flippin' Tables identity crisis explained:</strong><br>

<p>This game started as Flippin' Tables, a small and simple game I built mostly on my own, mostly to go through the publication processes of IOS and Android. 
While recently working with SVR Automated Intelligence, they were looking for an idea for a mobile game to release, so I offered this one up! We added new features and gave it a much more glamorous release as Flippin' Out, so download and enjoy it's 2021 makeover!</p>
